# Argo CD Multi-Cluster Demo
Inspired by Google Anthos Configuration Manager (ACM) I wondered if I could use 
Argo CD and a repository to auto-configure multiple Kubernetes clusters. This 
repo is my sandbox for testing this theory and playing with different features.

# TODO
Add more docs as I get everything working ;-)
